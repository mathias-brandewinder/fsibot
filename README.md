fsibot
======

fsibot, based on the capabilities of F# and Twitter with additional cloud services, 
is the online home for your development projects. Get up and running in minutes on 
our cloud infrastructure without having to install or configure a single server. 
fsibot connects to Twitter and the [F# Compiler Services](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/index.html), 
to support development for a single language, F#. Seriously, what else do you need?

fsibot is entirely free. As your team expands or your needs grow, 
with a simple Twitter account, give each user what they need. 

fsibot is a 100% buzzword compliant F# development environment:  

**A Cross Platform, Mobile experience**: let's face it, today is the age of the 
Digital Nomad. With fsibot, you can develop on the go, wherever you are. 
From the web, from your Smart Phone - the power of F# is there, at your 
finger tips.

**Cloud infrastructure**: fsibot is built on Microsoft Azure, all the way. 
Our cloud-hosted build infrastructure enables you to distribute the 
processor-intensive work of building your project to the cloud, 140
characters at a time. 

**Lean and Agile**: less lines of code, less bugs. fsibot encourages heathy coding practices, 
with a rapid feedback cycle: code it, ship it, done. If it doesn't work the 
first time, just Pivot and try again. This is ALM, made simple. You're welcome.
